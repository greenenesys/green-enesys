                permitted by law, this agreement is governed by the laws of the

                and venue of the Swiss Courts in all disputes arising out of or
                relating to the use of the Green Enesys Group GmbH website. Use
                of the Green Enesys Group GmbH website is unauthorized in any
                jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of
                these terms and conditions, including without limitation this
                paragraph. You agree that no joint venture, partnership,
                employment, or agency relationship exists between you and Green
                Enesys Group GmbH as a result of this agreement or use of the
                Green Enesys Group GmbH website. Green Enesys Group GmbH 's
                performance of this agreement is subject to existing laws and
                legal process, and nothing contained in this agreement is in
                derogation of Green Enesys Group GmbH right to comply with
                governmental, court and law enforcement requests or requirements
                relating to your use of the Green Enesys Group GmbH website or
                information provided to or gathered by Green Enesys Group GmbH
                with respect to such use. If any part of this agreement is
                determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable
                law including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and
                liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or
                unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid,
                enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of
                the original provision and the remainder of the agreement shall
                continue in effect. Unless otherwise specified herein, this
                agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the user and
                Green Enesys Group GmbH with respect to the Green Enesys Group
                GmbH website and it supersedes all prior or contemporaneous
                communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral or
                written, between the user and Green Enesys Group GmbH with
                respect to the GREEN ENESYS GROUP GMBH website. A printed
                version of this agreement and of any notice given in electronic
                form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative
                proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same
                extent an d subject to the same conditions as other business
                documents and records originally generated and maintained in
                printed form. It is the express wish to the parties that this
                agreement and all related documents be drawn up in English.
